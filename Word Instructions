In Word, you must save your document so you can quit the program without losing your work. When you save the document, it is stored as a file on your computer or in a network location. Later, you can open the file, change it, and print it.

To save a document, do the following:

Click the Save button in the Quick Access toolbar. If you've previously saved your document, it is now saved using its current file name and no more steps are needed. Otherwise, depending on the Word version, the Save As or Save this file window appears and you continue to follow the next steps.

Choose a location where you want to save the document and enter a file name in the File name box. To change the file name, type in a new file name.

Click Save.

You can open a Word document to resume your work. To open a document, do the following:

Open File Explorer, and click Documents. A list of documents appears.

If the document you want to work on is on the list, click the file name to open the document. If the document isn't on the list, navigate to the location where you stored your file, and double-click the file. The Word startup screen appears, and then the document is displayed.
